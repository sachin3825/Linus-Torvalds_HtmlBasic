      Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator
      and principal developer of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel for a
      number of operating systems. He also created the version control system
      Git. Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He
      studied computer science at the University of Helsinki, and he developed
